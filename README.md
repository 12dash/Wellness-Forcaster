# Wellness-Forecaster
Predict the wellness of the countries based on features and project it on a heat map

This project calculates wellness index of each countries on the basis of certain features. 
These features have been taken for the past 60 years and have been extrapolated till 2030.
Then a linear model is made with the help of machine learning to fit these data to the earlier target wellness index.

The data obtained have been projected on a map with coordinates of the countries and heat map using google api.

This project was made for NUS hack and roll .
